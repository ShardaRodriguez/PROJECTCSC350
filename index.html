    <p class= "p1">ABOUT SHARDA</p>
    <br>

    <p class="p2">Hello, I am Sharda Rodriguez.</p>
    <p class="p2">I love music, traveling, and cooking.
      I enjoy listening to Bachata, Salsa, Reggae, Ballad, and Pop music.
      I would like to travel around the world. I love tropical places. The beach is my favorite place,
      and I would like to visit Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I like cooking.
      I enjoy watching cooking shows and making recipes in my free time.
      <br>
      <p class="p2">I wanted to be a chef, but I changed my mind because I started to feel more passionate about computer programming.
      I started to pursue my passion and registered at BMCC to study Computer Science.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="p2">Currently, this is my fourth and last semester to earn my associate degree.
      After graduating from BMCC, I want to gain a lot of knowledge and experience in the field of computer science and be very successful in my career.
      My plan regarding studies is to transfer to John Jay College and earn a bachelorâ€™s degree in
      Computer and Information Systems Security.</p>
